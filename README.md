# The-Great-Number-Game

This was a project for my full-stack Coding Dojo course (Python). The goal was to make a number guessing game with a leaderboard.

Updating Soon:
--Making a leaderboard that is permanent...(connect to a DB)
--More responsiveness (button hovers, color changes, animations, etc.)
--Game-like functionality (losing the game, etc.)
